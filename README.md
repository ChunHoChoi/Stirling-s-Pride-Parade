## Stirling's Pride Parade - Gay(m) Jam 2019

A Short side-scrolling runner game inspired by a friend, made for the 2019 Gay(m) Jam hosted by the University of Brighton.
Using hand-drawn assets inspired by events or influences important to the team, Stirling's Pride Parade seeks 
to be an interactive representation of the trials that are experienced daily by members of the LGBTQIA+ community in day to 
day life, while also trying to spread awareness of these issues. 

Created over the period of 72 hours with the Unity game engine.
